Checking wheather the email is spam or not
#Background
Spam email check is the process of identifying and filtering unwanted or unsolicited emails, 
commonly known as spam, from legitimate emails. Spam emails are typically sent in bulk to a 
large number of recipients without their consent and can contain various forms of malicious 
content, such as phishing links, malware, or fraudulent schemes.

The detection and filtering of spam emails is an important task in email communication because 
it helps to reduce the risk of security breaches, protect personal information, and prevent users 
from falling prey to scams or other fraudulent activities.

Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in spam email detection as they are capable of 
analyzing large volumes of data, identifying patterns and anomalies, and making accurate predictions. 
These algorithms can be trained on labeled datasets of spam and non-spam emails to learn how to distinguish
between the two. Once trained, they can be used to classify new emails as either spam or legitimate based on 
their content, sender, and other features.
